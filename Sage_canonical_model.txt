// This a sample code that produces a canonical model of the curve X_{+-1,+-12}(29). We can use it in the same way for any other curve X_Delta(N). The code requires MD Sage to be installed previously.
// The file XH_29-12.m contains the model of the curve as well as the code for Magma to import that model.
